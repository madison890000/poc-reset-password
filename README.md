# poc-reset-password
This is an POC for resetting password in a react Web Application


# Requirements

We would like you to implement a POC for a basic password reset screen.
The user can enter a string which should be validated as a password.
The constraints for the password are at least 8 characters, including one number and two special characters or be greater than 15 characters with no restriction.
The reset should only be enabled if the new password is valid.
Unit tests should be provided.
You should provide only a single page POC for password reset functionality. Similarly, there is no need to provide build pipelines or a deployed website.
A README.md should be provided with clear instructions for building and executing the web app and running the tests (if appropriate).
